## Summary

The `release-notes` subcommand of krel is used to generate the release notes
draft of a kubernetes version. The subcommand can be used to generate release notes
files for a specific tag or a range of tags. It can output the notes files to Markdown or JSON formats.

This subcommand can be used to generate the release notes draft for the current development version of kubernetes and the JSON version that power relnotes.k8s.io.
`krel release-notes` will create a branch in a user's fork of the corresponding repositories, commit and push the changes. Filing the final PRs to the kubernetes org repositories is in development and will soon be ready.

## Installation

After [installing krel](README.md#installation), you will need to [get a GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to run the release-notes subcommand.

If you want to generate the JSON patches for relnotes.k8s.io you will need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run the JSON formatter.

## Usage

Before running `krel release-notes` export your GitHub token to \$GITHUB_TOKEN:

```
  export GITHUB_TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE
  krel release-notes [flags]

### Examples

`krel release-notes` has three main modes of operation:

#### Ouput the Releas Notes to a single file

The following command will generate the release notes for the 1.18 branch up to beta.2 in /var/www/html/

```bash
krel release-notes -o /var/www/html/ --format markdown --tag v1.18.0-beta.2
```

#### Generate the current markdown draft

This invocation will generate the release notes draft [published in sig-release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.18/release-notes-draft.md). It will generate the draft for the v1.18 branch up to rc.1. The draft will be written in my local fork of kubernetes/sig-release. `krel release-notes` will clone k/sig-release, create a branch, write the draft and then push the changes back to github, in `kubefriend/sig-release`.

```bash
krel release-notes --create-draft-pr --tag v1.18.0-rc.1 --draft-org=kubefriend
```

#### Update the relnotes.k8s.io website

The subcommand can also generate the notes and modify the necessary files to update the [release notes website](https://relnotes.k8s.io/). This invocation will clone the [release-notes repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-notes) and add my fork as a remote (kubefriend/release-notes). It will then create a feature branch to commit the notes up to v1.18 alpha.1 and update the website files. Finally it will push the changes to my GitHub repo:

```bash
krel release-notes --tag v1.18.0-alpha.1 --website-org=kubefriend --create-website-pr
```

## Important notes and issues

- The /tmp defaults shown in the flags above are for Linux. Other platform will default to Go's `os.TempDir()` (for example, on a the Mac the actual path will be under `/var/folders/â€¦` ).

- The `release-notes` subcommand will eventually create the PR for you. This is still under development though.

- If krel is interrupted while cloning, it might leave the repository at an unusable state. We recommend deleting any incomplete repositories before running krel again.

- Make sure [git `author.email`](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address) matches the address you used to sign the CNCF's CLA.

- If krel was run without forking `kubernetes/sig-release` and `kubernetes-sigs/release-notes`, the commit will be created but pushing to your fork will fail.
